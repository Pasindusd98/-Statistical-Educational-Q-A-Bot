## Why This Project Matters

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, **statistics is a foundational skill** across nearly every academic discipline and industry â€” from psychology and economics to AI and public health. Yet, many learners struggle with understanding statistical terms, the logic behind hypothesis testing, or the interpretation of results.

This Q&A bot is built to:
-  **Democratize access** to clear, concise statistical explanations
-  Support **independent learners** and students studying remotely
-  Serve as a **revision aid** or **study companion** during coursework and exam prep
- Be deployable in resource-constrained environments (low RAM, no GPU)

It brings intelligent tutoring to your browser â€” no need for textbooks, tutors, or expensive software.

## How It Works

1. The user types a statistics-related question.
2. The bot encodes the question using a **small language model** (`MiniLM`) from `sentence-transformers`.
3. The system matches it to the most relevant question in a **300-entry Q&A dataset** using cosine similarity.
4. The matching answer is returned instantly through a clean, interactive UI.

## Example Questions It Can Answer

- What is a p-value?
- Explain central limit theorem.
- What is the difference between mean and median?
- What is standard deviation?
- What is a confidence interval?
